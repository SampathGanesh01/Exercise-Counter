Some of the video snippet before using mediapipe and opencv

after using mediapipe and opencv 

we can observe the detections and rep count

it will also shows us wheather the person in the feed is bending or strecthing his leg 

I have written code for detection of leg and bending of leg 

we can also see by how much angle does the user or person in feed bent this leg

We can apply it to live camera feed if we can change the videocapture value to 0 i.e here in below

if we delete the KneeBendVideo.mp4 and change it to zero then it will enable our camera
